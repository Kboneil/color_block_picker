# Color Picker Challange

"Color Picker" is a game that allows the user to interact with boxes on the page.

## Features

There are multiple different interactive features that make the game more interesting.

### Feature 1

The user is prompted with a randomly chosen color. If they click on the right color, they are told it is correct and a new color to pick is chosen. Otherwise, they keep trying.

### Feature 2

There is a button that adds randomly colored boxes and another that removes the final box on click.

### Feature 3 

When the correct box is chosen, it changes color and expands, and then reverses back to its original size and color.
